# CVPR-NAS

## About

CVPR-NAS is an annual competition that compares how well Neural Search Architectures can apply machine learning methods to unseen datasets. Competitors must register with a website so that they can download a starting kit and datasets, then use these resources to complete their NAS algorithm.

Their code based entry is then uploaded to the same website which must then allocate resources and run their submitted code. This code run is time limited to one hour. There will only be a limited number of GPUs available to run the code, so jobs may be queued and executed in the order received.

Between 5-10 submissions are expected per day during the allowed submission period. Competitors will ideally have email notification of their code status. It is expected that code will be uploaded in a zip format.

## Built With

[Strapi](https://docs.strapi.io/)  
[Vue](https://vuejs.org/)  


## Getting Started

No specific technology is preferred for the website, however it must be able to deploy Azure based applications to run the competition code.

Project milestones relate to the phases of the competition.

The website must be able to collect data from running the competition submissions and display a ranking of competitor results.

Last years website is available for reference at:

### Prerequisites

Any tools or versions of languages needed to run code. For example specific Python or Node versions. Minimum hardware requirements also go here.

### Installation

How to build or install the applcation.

### Running Locally

How to run the application on your local system.

### Running Tests

How to run tests on your local system.

## Deployment

### Local

Deploying to a production style setup but on the local system. Examples of this would include `venv`, `anaconda`, `Docker` or `minikube`. 

### Production

Deploying to the production system. Examples of this would include cloud, HPC or virtual machine. 

## Usage

Any links to production environment, video demos and screenshots.

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial Research  
- [ ] Minimum viable product <-- You are Here  
- [ ] Alpha Release  
- [ ] Feature-Complete Release  

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on.
